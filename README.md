# chatbot
This is my first uploaded code in Github! Hope you enjoy.

In this chatbot program, I have learnt how to use fuctions in Python. I also learnt about ANSI escape sequences which made my texts bolded.

How to chat with my virtual companion, Gary:
1. Place your message that you want to say in the "Type here:" space.
2. Click the enter key and the message from my chatbot will pop up, bolded.
3. After the mess
