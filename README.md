# Chat with Gary
This is my first uploaded code in Github! Hope you enjoy.

In this chatbot program, I have learnt how to use fuctions in Python. I also learnt about ANSI escape sequences which made my texts bolded.

How to chat with my virtual companion, Gary:
1. Place your message that you want to say in the "Type here:" space.
2. Click the enter key and the message from my chatbot will pop up, bolded.
3. If you would like to send a anothor message to Gary, type your message below the bolded text.
4. Repeat 3. until you want to stop chatting with Gary. If you would like to end the chat with Gary, type setences with the words bye, leave, or exit.
